title: Cell click actions
jupyter: python3
---

You can add cell click actions using the onClick argument, which accepts the following values:

* "expand" to expand the row
* "select" to select the row
* A JavaScript function for a custom action, e.g., sending the click event to Shiny

## Expand on click

{{< embed ../examples/index.qmd#click-expand echo=true >}}

## Select on click

{{< embed ../examples/index.qmd#click-select echo=true >}}

## Custom action

This example uses a custom click action to create custom “show details” action buttons in each row of the table:

{{< embed ../examples/index.qmd#click-custom echo=true >}}

Custom click actions are currently not accessible to keyboard users, and are generally not recommended. If they must be used, ensure that they can be triggered by a keyboard through other means, such as a button in the example above.
